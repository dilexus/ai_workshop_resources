Overall Style: Cinematic, hyper realistic, warm, idyllic, natural lighting, gentle pace.





Scene: A vibrant, sun-drenched late afternoon in rural Sri Lanka.





Visuals:





Characters:





Dilini: A 25-year-old Sri Lankan woman, expressive face, radiating warmth. She is wearing a light, knee-length summer dress with a delicate floral pattern (e.g., white with small jasmine or hibiscus prints).

Kalani: A 25-year-old Sri Lankan woman, bright-eyed and energetic. She is wearing a similarly styled flowery summer dress, perhaps in a different pastel color (e.g., light yellow or peach with complementary floral prints).

Both have natural, flowing dark hair.

Setting: A narrow, slightly muddy footpath winding through a vast, lush, vibrant green rice paddy field. The rice stalks are mature and full. Distant, hazy green hills or a tree line can be seen on the horizon. The sky is a clear blue with a few wispy clouds, tinged with the golden light of the late afternoon sun.





Action:





The video opens with Dilini and Kalani walking casually side-by-side along the path, moving from screen left to screen right (or vice-versa, consistently).

Kalani turns slightly towards Dilini as she begins to speak, her expression animated and excited.

Dilini reacts with visible surprise, her eyes widening, and a delighted smile spreading across her face. She might momentarily pause her stride.

Kalani continues, her expression reassuring and encouraging, perhaps with a light, friendly gesture.





Camera Work:





Shot Type: Medium shot, keeping both women comfortably in frame from the waist up, allowing their expressions and the beauty of the rice field background to be clearly visible.





Movement: Gentle, smooth tracking shot that moves alongside the women as they walk. Alternatively, a stable shot where they walk towards the camera, which then subtly pans to follow them as they continue.





Focus: Sharp focus on the characters, with a slight cinematic bokeh effect on the distant background.





Lighting: Warm, golden hour lighting, creating soft shadows and highlighting the green of the rice fields.





Audio:





Music: Soft, calm, traditional Sri Lankan flute music playing gently and unobtrusively in the background. It should evoke a sense of peace and cultural richness.





Ambient Sounds: Subtle sounds of nature: a gentle breeze rustling through the rice paddies, distant chirping of crickets or birds (optional, very low mix).





Dialogue: Clear, natural-sounding Sinhala dialogue with the specified emotional inflections.





Dialogue (with emotional cues):





Kalani (walking, turns to Dilini, voice full of excitement and a touch of playful teasing):

"දිලි​නි.. ඒ අයි නිසා අපේ වැඩ ඔක්කොම ලේසි වේගන එන්​නේ!"

(Translation: Dilini, Due to AI our work is getting easy!)





Dilini (stops or slows, face lights up with genuine surprise and delight, looking at Kalani):

"වාව්! ඇත්තටමද කලණි, මටත් ඉගෙන ගන්න ආස​යි?"

(Translation: Wow! Really, Kalani, I also want to learn?)
