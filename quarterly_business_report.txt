title: Quarterly Business Report

dear team,

I hope this email finds you well. i wanted to provide an update on the business performance for the last quarter. we have seen a steady increase in sales, with a growth rate of 15%. however, customer retention needs improvement as we noticed a slight decline in repeat purchases.

key areas of focus for next quarter include:
	•	Improving customer engagement
	•	Enhancing marketing strategies
	•	streamlining internal processes

please review the attached document for more details. let’s discuss this in our upcoming meeting next monday.

thank you,
john
